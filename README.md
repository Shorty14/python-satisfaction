python-satisfaction
===================

This is a Python wrapper around the [getsatisfaction API](http://getsatisfaction.com/developers/ "Developer Documentation"). It's at a very early stage of development, and isn't yet capable of anything useful.

Contributions would be gratefully accepted (please include tests...).
